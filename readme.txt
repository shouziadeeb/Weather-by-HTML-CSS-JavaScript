Approach & Challenges Faced

ðŸ”¹ Approach

Fetch Weather Data

Used the fetch() method to retrieve weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Displayed temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions dynamically.

Search by City

Implemented an input field where users can type a city name and fetch real-time weather updates.

Geolocation API

Used the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition() method to retrieve latitude and longitude.

Converted latitude/longitude to a city name using Reverse Geocoding.

Passed the location data to the weather API.
